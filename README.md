# Coronavirus/COVID-19 Timseries Forecasting

# Business Problem

- Covid-19 and the various strains that have since emerged has upended modern life and fundamental changed how we function as a society.
- Part of what has made it difficult to tackle the pandemic is due to differences between states, state laws/policies, and a lack of public understanding about the predictability of the surges in cases. 


### Goal

- The goal of this notebook is to produce a workflow for producing forecasts of the following metrics at least 1 week ahead of time. 
    - Confirmed Cases
    - Number of Deaths
    - ICU Capacity
    
- The stretch goal for the project is to create a streamlit dashboard for getting state-level forecasts for any state in the US, using fresh daily data.
    

### Methodology

- To select 3-5 prototypical states representing very different time courses/
- Initial Thoughts:
    - NY
    - TX
    - FL
    - MD
    - LA

- See `data_acquisition.py`> `FULL_WORKFLOW()` and `1_Replacing Covid Tracking Project - Simplified Workflow.ipynb` for details (for now)

#### Data Quality Issues
- There are strong spikes +/- that are not likely to be real values.

### MD - Cases-New


```python
col = 'Cases-New'
ts = df_state[col].copy()
ax = ts.plot(title=f"{state}-{col}");
ax.set_ylabel(col)
```




    Text(0, 0.5, 'Cases-New')

```python

```
